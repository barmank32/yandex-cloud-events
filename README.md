# Events API Yandex Cloud

Collection of tools that were used on rebrainme's webinar with yandex cloud.

# Tools!

- **terraform** - terraform files for container registry, service accounts, instances, instance group, load balancer, cloudflare's dns
- **ansible** - ansible playbooks for docker, kafka, grafana, prometheus
- **app** - small application server which receives json events through http and push them to kafka (should be rewritten with fasthttp and some optimizations).
- **grafana** - dashboards used at webinar
- **load** - yandex tank configration for load testing

# Tested versions
- terraform:
```sh
$ terraform version
Terraform v0.12.18
```

- ansible:
```sh
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.4
```

- golang: 1.13.8 from docker golang:latest

- yandex tank:
```sh
# docker run -v /home/cloud-user/load/:/var/loadtest/ --network host -it direvius/yandex-tank --version
No handlers could be found for logger "netort.resource"
YandexTank/1.12.1
```

# Terraform
To run terraform you should create **private.auto.tfvars** file with the following content:
```ini
yc_token = "YANDEX CLOUD OAUTH TOKEN"
yc_cloud_id = "YANDEX CLOUD ID"
yc_folder_id = "YANDEX CLOUD FOLDER ID"
cf_email = "CLOUDFLARE EMAIL"
cf_token = "CLOUDFLARE TOKEN"
cf_zone_id = "CLOUDFLARE ZONE ID"
```

Then just run:
```sh
$ terraform apply
```

# Ansible
In fact, ansible is not used directly - it is run by terraform to provision kafka, build and monitoring hosts. Anyway, you have to download all the roles from anible galaxy:
```sh
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

Also, you can use provided .ansible.cfg file.

# Load
First of all signup to [yandex overload](http://overload.yandex.net) if you want to get some visualisation on the web. After you're in - obtain your api key and write it down to **token.txt** file.

After that you can easily run load test using docker:
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/var/loadtest/ --net host -it direvius/yandex-tank -c load.yml ammo.txt
```

**ammo.txt** can be generated with ammo generators - [Official doc](https://yandextank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ammo_generators.html)

# Grafana
Just import dashboard to your grafana instance and select proper prometheus data source - thats it!

# Application
Use docker to build the container:
```sh
$ docker build -t app .
```

Then you can run it with:
```sh
$ docker run -d --name api -p 8080:8080 api
```

Some flags are used by the app:
- **-addr** - address to listen to. By default - :8080
- **-kafka** - separated list of kafka brokers to use (i.e. 10.0.0.1:9092,10.0.0.2:9092). By default - 127.0.0.1:9092
